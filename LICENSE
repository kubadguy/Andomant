Key Changes / Clarifications

“Modification” now explicitly includes:

Code changes

Structural changes (file/folder organization, internal architecture)

Feature additions/removals

Inclusion or integration into other projects

“>50% modification” is measured holistically across these dimensions, not just line count.

Deployment for internal/private use does not require source release, unless >50% modified.
