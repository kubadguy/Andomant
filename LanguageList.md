# Andomant Language List (v0.1.0)

Core foundational languages:
- C (core engine, low-level performance)
- C++ (system components)
- Rust (safety + concurrency)
- Go (cloud, distributed systems)
- D (high-performance utilities)

Scripting and rapid dev:
- Python (AI/ML, scripting glue)
- Ruby (domain DSLs, tooling)
- Perl (text/data processing)
- TypeScript (frontend + APIs)
- JavaScript (runtime extensions)

Functional and advanced:
- Scala (concurrency, FP)
- Haskell (pure FP experiments)
- OCaml (compiler logic)
- F# (cross-platform .NET FP)

Enterprise and JVM-based:
- Java (interop, services)
- Kotlin (clean JVM services)
- C# (interop with .NET world)

Other systems and niche:
- Zig (low-level safe code)
- Nim (lightweight systems programming)
- Lua (embeddable scripting)
- R (data analytics)
- Julia (scientific computing)
- Elixir (distributed systems)

â€¦and many more (total target: **38**).  
Each language will have a **dedicated role** inside the Andomant ecosystem.
